  <app-info-pane
    paneHeader="About Me"
    paneTextContent="As a business owner in the professional services sector, you’re at a crossroad. Your business
    isn’t working as you want it to.  You wake up each morning wanting to feel energised but by the end of the day you
    wonder what you have achieved.  The business feels disjointed and people don’t seem to understand what their roles are.<br>
    <br>
    Using an analogy of a car engine, you lift the bonnet up and start adjusting a few things to try and improve what
    you think is the problem but the adjustments seem to cause problems elsewhere. Even though you tackle the symptoms
    you just can’t pinpoint the root cause.  Your staff lack motivation and profits stagnate.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Don’t worry - this is a natural evolution which happens in all growing business.  What got you to where you are
    now, won’t take you where you want to go.</b>"

    If you’re not feeling good about your business, the business won’t be sustainable.<br>
    <br>

    Which is why I have developed a proven model to help you transition to a more efficient, more profitable business
    model and a culture where your people feel motivated and love turning up for work."

    <br>
    <i>'I have worked with Sue as our Business Coach since we bought the business a year ago. Through this period of
    massive learning, she has been a huge support. Sue is able to give just the right level of advice for a situation
    without overloading. She always responds quickly with excellent advice, every time. If you are looking for calm,
    knowledgeable, and practical support as you grow your business, look no further'</i>  <br>- Mike Keig
    <br><br>
    <i>'The initial consultancy session gave me the clarity I needed to make some changes to my business.  
    These few changes more than covered the consultancy fee but I always say the proof is in the pudding, which was 
    amply demonstrated. In addition to making changes within the business, Sue also inspired me to move my personal
    qualifications forward & I achieved Chartered status within 2 ½ years of our initial consultation, which over the
    last 6 years has brought further tangible benefit to the business & a great deal of personal satisfaction'</i>
    <br>- Mark Curtis – Perry Appleton <br>
    <br>
    <i>'Susan is a lovely person and an excellent listener who can see through to the core of an issue. She is very
    supportive and generous of spirit, and gently, but firmly, guides in the right direction. She is knowledgeable and
    talented and I would wholeheartedly recommend her services'</i>  <br>- Julie Williams – Home Instead, Dudley"
