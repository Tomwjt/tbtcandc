    paneHeader="ABOUT YOU"
    paneTextContent="As a business owner in the professional services sector, you’re at a crossroad.
    You want to feel energised by what you do, and you want the business to be successful but it’s just
    not working the way you want it to.<br>
    <br>
    Using an analogy of a car engine, you lift the bonnet up and start adjusting a few things to try and fix
    what you think is the issue but the adjustments seem to cause problems elsewhere. Even though you tackle
    the symptoms you just can’t pinpoint the root cause.  Your staff seem to lack motivation and profits stagnate.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Don’t worry - this is a natural evolution which happens in all growing businesses.  What got you to where you are
    now, won’t take you where you want to go.</b>"

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <app-info-pane
    paneHeader="LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF"
    paneTextContent="Hi there, I’m Sue Jones.  I live in Penrhyn Bay, a beautiful part of the world just
    near Little Orme, Llandudno. Why did I start my business? I loved working with and supporting the
    businesses in my previous role but doing 30,000 miles a year, working away most weeks from this beautiful
    place I live, just wasn’t working for me.  Also my mum passed away last year.  Most of you will have
    experienced loss and will know iis always a time for reflection.  I had to get the work/life balance
    right, so I created Thoughts Become Things.<br>
    <br>
    I absolutely love people!  I’m curious about what makes you, you. I want to find out what motivates
    you and what makes you feel passionate about what you do? <br>
    <br>
    What motivates and drives me is having a direct impact on the businesses
    I work with.  The buzz I get when business owners at the end of the process are
    smiling because they, for the first time in a long time, feel happy with where they
    are and where the business is heading.  That makes me smile too. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Thoughts may be the starting point, but expertise helps!<br></b>

    <i>'The initial consultancy session gave me the clarity I needed to make some changes to my business.  
    These few changes more than covered the consultancy fee but I always say the proof is in the pudding, which was 
    amply demonstrated. In addition to making changes within the business, Sue also inspired me to move my personal
    qualifications forward & I achieved Chartered status within 2 ½ years of our initial consultation, which over the
    last 6 years has brought further tangible benefit to the business & a great deal of personal satisfaction'</i>

    supportive and generous of spirit, and gently, but firmly, guides in the right direction. She is knowledgeable and
    talented and I would wholeheartedly recommend her services'</i>  <br>- Julie Williams – Home Instead, Dudley"
