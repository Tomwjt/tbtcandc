    Introducing Thoughts Become Things<br>
  </p>
  <p class="intro_text">
    <br>
    Hi There<br>
    <br>
    I’m Sue Jones, creator of Thoughts Become Things Coaching and Consulting.<br>
    <br>
    The name “Thoughts Become Things” is very much a part of my journey to setting up this business.  The Franchise I was working for (Home Instead Senior Care UK) was embarking on a 360 Leadership programme in 2017.   Within this programme there was a video by Mike Dooley whose main message is that the thoughts you have create your own reality. Link is here!<br>
    Whilst launching this Programme my thought was that I want to do this for myself, without the confines of an organisation. I wanted to set up my own business enabling as many leaders and business owners to make better decisions for their business.  So my thought has become a thing, I did it!  It’s a real entity.<br>
    <br>
    So what do I do ……<br>
    <br>
    My passion is working with business owners and leaders to not only get the best out of themselves but also the people within their business.
    <br>
    This is done by reviewing three key areas.

  <ul class="intro_text">
    <li>Leadership</li>
    <li>Process</li>
    <li>People</li>
  </ul>

    Within this website I want to provide you with everything you need to know to run a successful business.  This will be based on a raft of experience from the franchise world, home care and financial services.
